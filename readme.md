# D8 Home-built CPU project
Design and build an 8-bit CPU using transistors

Follow the [build journal](/docs/journal.md)

## But... why?

## Tasks

Rough order of tasks:

1. Define what I'd like this CPU to _do_, and the technology that I'd like to use
2. Come up with an assembly language
  - What opcodes?
  - What registers?
  - What will the `.asm` file format look like? And machine code?
  - Write some dummy programs in the assembly language (like multiply and Fibonacci) to check that the opcodes that I'm using can do what I want
3. Write a simple 2-pass assembler to convert assembly in to machine code
4. Write an emulator to run the machine code; Write a simple GUI to step through and visualise the state of the CPU after each instruction
5. Build the CPU in a digital circuit simulator, work out the bugs
6. Create circuit diagrams, buy components and start wiring up the circuit
7. ...... get it working?
8. Write a C compiler
9. Compile a (simple) OS, connect the CPU to the internet and server a simple web page??

My process has been a lot more iterative than this list makes out, and sometimes I get to a step, have a re-think or discover a problem and then go back to previous steps.
